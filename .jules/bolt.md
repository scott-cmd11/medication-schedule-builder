## 2026-02-03 - [Optimizing Streamlit Inline Search Loop]
**Learning:** In Streamlit applications, inline list comprehensions that run on every re-render (like search filtering) can be a significant bottleneck if they involve repetitive string operations (e.g., `.lower()`). Even with a small dataset (~1000 items), these operations add up when performed on every keystroke or interaction. Pre-normalizing data (e.g., storing uppercase keys) and uppercasing the query *once* before the loop yielded a ~2x performance improvement (1.47s -> 0.74s for 10k iters).
**Action:** When implementing search logic in Streamlit render loops, always hoist invariant transformations (like query normalization) out of the loop and prefer direct comparisons against pre-normalized data fields over repetitive string methods.
